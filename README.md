# stockprice-predict
> Repository of making prediction of the stock price, referred from the data of Yahoo Finance

Hi devs, I would say that this would be the last repository in 2023 (which I created on December 29th 2023), and I am kind of interesting on time series prediction. So that, I decided to create repository of predicting stock prices in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset that I included was from Yahoo! Finance, and it will look up the history within 3 months from the present.

More information/documentation will be include in this repository. Thank you

Finally, I would like to give you to see the visualization from using Plotly Express [here](stockprice.html)
